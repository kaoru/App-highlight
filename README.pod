=head1 NAME

App::highlight - simple grep-like highlighter app

=head1 SYNOPSIS

highlight is similar to grep, except that instead of removing
non-matched lines it simply highlights words or lines which are
matched.

    % cat words.txt
    foo
    bar
    baz
    qux
    quux
    corge

    % cat words.txt | grep ba
    bar
    baz

    % cat words.txt | highlight ba
    foo
    >>ba<<r
    >>ba<<z
    qux
    quux
    corge

Note that angle brackets are not used to highlight the words,
Term::ANSIColor terminal highlighting is used.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head1 no-escape [n]

This allows you to specify a regular expression instead of a simple
string.

    % cat words.txt | highlight --no-escape '[abcde]+'
    foo
    >>ba<<r
    >>ba<<z
    qux
    quux
    >>c<<org>>e<<

=head1 full-line

This makes highlight always highlight full lines of input, even when
the full line is not matched.

    % cat words.txt | highlight --full-line u
    foo
    bar
    baz
    >>qux<<
    >>quux<<
    corge

Note this is similar to '--no-escape "^.*match.*$"' but probably much
more efficient.
