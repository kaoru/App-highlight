=head1 NAME

App::highlight - simple grep-like highlighter app

=head1 SYNOPSIS

highlight is similar to grep, except that instead of removing
non-matched lines it simply highlights words or lines which are
matched.

    % cat words.txt
    foo
    bar
    baz
    qux
    quux
    corge

    % cat words.txt | grep ba
    bar
    baz

    % cat words.txt | highlight ba
    foo
    <<ba>>r
    <<ba>>z
    qux
    quux
    corge

If you give multiple match parameters highlight will highlight each of them in
a different color.

    % cat words.txt | highlight ba qu
    foo
    <<ba>>r
    <<ba>>z
    [[qu]]x
    [[qu]]ux
    corge

=head1 Color Support

If you have Term::ANSIColor installed then the strings will be highlighted
using terminal colors rather than using brackets.

Installing color support by installing Term::ANSIColor is highly reccommended.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 color / c

This is the default if Term::ANSIColor is installed.

App::highlight will cycle through the colours:

    red green yellow blue magenta cyan

If you do not have Term::ANSIColor installed and you specify --color or you do
not specify --no-color then you will receive a warning.

=head2 no-color / C

This is the default if Term::ANSIColor is not installed.

App::highlight will cycle through the brackets:

    <<match>> [[match]] ((match))  {{match}} **match** __match__

The examples in the rest of this document use this mode because showing color
highlighting in POD documentation is not possible.

=head2 escape / e

This is the default and means that the strings passed in will be escaped so
that no special characters exist.

    % cat words.txt | highlight --escape 'ba' '[qux]'
    foo
    <<ba>>r
    <<ba>>z
    qux
    quux
    <<c>>org<<e>>

=head2 no-escape / n / regex / r

This allows you to specify a regular expression instead of a simple
string.

    % cat words.txt | highlight --no-escape 'ba' '[qux]'
    foo
    <<ba>>r
    <<ba>>z
    [[q]][[u]][[x]]
    [[q]][[u]][[u]][[x]]
    corge

=head2 full-line / l

This makes highlight always highlight full lines of input, even when
the full line is not matched.

    % cat words.txt | highlight --full-line u
    foo
    bar
    baz
    <<qux>>
    <<quux>>
    corge

Note this is similar to '--no-escape "^.*match.*$"' but probably much
more efficient.

=head2 one-color / o

Rather than cycling through multiple colors, this makes highlight always use
the same color for all highlights.

Despite the name "one-color" this interacts with the --no-color option as you
would expect.

    % cat words.txt | highlight --one-color ba qu
    foo
    <<ba>>r
    <<ba>>z
    <<qu>>x
    <<qu>>ux
    corge

=head2 show-bad-spaces / b

With this option turned on whitespace characters which appear at the end of
lines are colored red.

For users familiar with git, this is replicating the default behaviour of "git
diff".

In non-color mode whitespace characters which appear at the end of lines are
filled in with capital "X" characters instead.

    % cat words_with_spaces | highlight --show-bad-spaces
    test
    test with spaces
    test with spaces on the endXXXX
    just spaces on the next line
    XXXXXXXX
    empty line next

    end of test

=head2 help / h

Show a brief help message

    % highlight --help
